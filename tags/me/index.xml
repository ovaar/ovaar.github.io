      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;very-first-blog-post&#34;&gt;Very first blog post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long time thinking whether I would or should start a blog, I finally have! As a dyslectic software engineer this is exciting for me because writing and reading is not easy for me. (Spoiler) Some very critical readers will find flaws in my writing, I am sure about that üòá.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/13GIgrGdslD9oQ/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;jim carry typing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I have started this blog is to write about my best achievements, creative solutions to problems me and my colleagues have come up with over time, to inspire others about software engineering, to reflect about my professional career but also to improve my technical writing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still interested, continue reading&amp;hellip;
I will give a short introduction about myself, my name is Thomas Reynders I am a enthusiastic software engineer. I live and work in the Dutch Silicon Valley area: Eindhoven. Since I was just a little kid I have been interested in technology. My dad worked at Philips and always had some hardware such as radios laying around which I could take apart. While video games got me hooked to playing with computers I always have felt a relation to hardware. It intrigues me and it has some kind of magical about it. My technical interest are in the IoT and high speed data processing domain. Working with embedded devices or big machines is awesome because making a product come to life and seeing things come together is super satisfying! (I think allot of engineers can relate to this üòÅ). In my free time I like to work in the garden, working on personal projects such as the smart mirror &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ovaar/mirrorm8/tree/dev&#34;&gt;mirrorm8&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and doing sports such as running and cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish my first post I would like to thank &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/andybrewer&#34;&gt;andybrewer&lt;/a&gt; for building &lt;a href=&#34;https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/&#34;&gt;MVP.css&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/andybrewer&#34;&gt;embik&lt;/a&gt; for building a Hugo &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/embik/hugo-theme-lyla.git&#34;&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; üëç.&lt;/p&gt;
