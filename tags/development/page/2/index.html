            <h3>How to build Macos Universal Binaries with Conan and CMake</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Universal Binaries contain native instructions for multiple target architectures like x86_64 and arm64 to run your app both on Intel Mac and Apple silicon machines. When using Conan there are a few common build systems, or native build tool generators, when creating packages from the Conan Center Index(CCI) like: CMake, Autotools, Pkgconfig, b2 (Boost Build) and Make. Some of these build tools have build-in support when it comes to building Universal Binaries.</p>

            <h3>How a smart mirror project finished after years of work</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Introduction Early 2019 I noticed the Magic Mirror project. To me the way of how woodworking and technology come together really got me. I just had to build one from scratch, ofcourse. It was a great opportunity for me to build something physical and learn a few things about some fancy new JavaScript frontend framework. I decided to call it the mirrorm8 project. I never wrote about it until now.</p>

            <h3>C# Performance - Profiling introduction</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Welcome! In this blog series I will share some of the knowledge I gained when doing performance optimizations for a project some time ago. Optimizing code for performance requires good knowledge of the fundamental concepts of computer architecture. In this first blog post I will explain about software profiling, some of the computer architecture concepts and my personal experience what worked for my and what did not. In later post(s) I will go more into detail in how to optimize code for performance.</p>

            <h3>Reactive testing with Gherkin, ReactiveX and asyncio</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Have you ever written integration test with asynchronous behavior? I have, and it has always been a struggle&hellip; CI/CD pipelines which regularly fail because of some timeout. Then, &ldquo;a wild project manager appears!&rdquo;, and starts asking questions why investigating takes so long&hellip;
 Solution: The timeout is increased to quickly solve the issue, when usually the failure is caused by regression.
 There must be some more elegant way to assert or await asynchronous calls in Behavior Driven Development (BDD) steps.</p>

            <h3>How to setup docker credential-store</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Since docker version 19 it start notifying the user that the docker credentials are stored unencrypted.
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted â€¦To solve this we will use the Docker credential-store feature.
 Ubuntu: docker-credential-pass OSX: osxkeychain Windows: wincred  In this blog post we are going to use install the latest docker-credential-pass helper in combination with pass as a store and gpg for key generation.
sudo apt-get install -y pass gpg gpg2 --gen-key # copy gpg-key pass init &#34;&lt;gpg-pub-key&gt;&#34; sed -i &#39;0,/{/s/{/{\n\t&#34;credsStore&#34;: &#34;pass&#34;,/&#39; ~/.</p>
