            <h3>[Docker] Setup docker credential-store</h3>
          </a>
          <p>[Docker] Setup docker credential-store Since docker version 19 it start notifying the user that the docker credentials are stored unencrypted.
WARNING! Your password will be stored unencrypted â€¦To solve this we will use the Docker credential-store feature.
 Ubuntu: docker-credential-pass OSX: osxkeychain Windows: wincred  In this blog post we are going to use install the latest docker-credential-pass helper in combination with pass as a store and gpg for key generation.</p>

            <h3>[Linux] Setting MAC address</h3>
          </a>
          <p>[Linux] Setting MAC address Last post I wrote about a embedded device running Linux where a MAC address is stored in the EEPROM. The first six bytes are reserved for the MAC address which (ideally) only should be written once.
To apply the MAC address the numbers need to be hexadecimal formatted and separated with a colon(:) symbol. It is possible to dynamically change the MAC address of Ethernet, beware that you need to be root and that the ethernet interface is not up.</p>

            <h3>[Linux] Yocto interactive shell</h3>
          </a>
          <p>[Linux] yocto interactive shell This post is about a feature request which I have implemented, at time of writing, about 2 years back. It always stuck with me because the project I was doing at the time was my first yocto experience. Topic has its own BSP for FPGA boards on top of a Linux distribution. A custom board was specifically designed for a customor which would run our software that would interface with another custom low power embedded device.</p>

            <h3>First Post</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Very first blog post After a long time thinking whether I would or should start a blog, I finally have! As a dyslectic software engineer this is exciting for me because writing and reading is not easy for me. (Spoiler) Some very critical readers will find flaws in my writing, I am sure about that ðŸ˜‡.
The reason I have started this blog is to write about my best achievements, creative solutions to problems me and my colleagues have come up with over time, to inspire others about software engineering, to reflect about my professional career but also to improve my technical writing skills.</p>
