            <h3>Yocto interactive shell</h3>
          </a>
          <p>[Linux] yocto interactive shell One of the reasons I have started this blog is to write about my best achievements. This post is about a feature request which I have implemented, at time of writing, about 2 years back. It always stuck with me because the project I was doing at the time was my first yocto experience. Topic has its own BSP for FPGA boards on top of a Linux distribution.</p>

            <h3>First Post</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Very first blog post After a long time thinking whether I would or should start a blog, I finally have! As a dyslectic software engineer this is exciting for me because writing and reading is not easy for me. (Spoiler) Some very critical readers will find flaws in my writing, I am sure about that ðŸ˜‡.
The reason I have started this blog is to write about my best achievements, creative solutions to problems me and my colleagues have come up with over time, to inspire others about software engineering, to reflect about my professional career but also to improve my technical writing skills.</p>
